This repository contains the R script used in my analysis of 12 months of Divvy bikeshare data as part of the Google/Coursera Data Analytics Certificate course capstone project. I am unable to upload the raw data to this repository due to file size limitations. The outputs of the analysis as well as findings and recommendations for the fictional company, Cyclistics, can be found in the PDF of the stakeholder report.
